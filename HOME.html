<br>Hi guys, I am here to introduce to you my partner Patrick Bobiles. He is a lad who lives in 
<br>Marikina, 21 years of age and going 22 years old on March 7, 2017. When he is still a baby 
<br>his family stayed in Manila for good and he even did not know if he or they have a province 
<br>because according to him they have been staying in Marikina or San Juan. It's like an hour 
<br>of driving between two places. He also shared that he has only one sibling and he is the 
<br>bunso in the family and he has an ate. And for his hobbies there is no doubt when he said 
<br>he likes to go to the gym, as you can see he had a buff body that is a real output of regularly 
<br>going to a gym. It's good nowadays to go to the gym especially after Christmas and 
<br>New Years season because it's time to shed off some fat that you gained in the past 
<br>celebrations, in fact it is the most used "New Year's Resolution" by everyone. Although 
<br>some do it and is dedicated but for some, they just do it for a couple of weeks then go back 
<br>to their old ways, sadly but I'm one of them haha. Another hobby of him is playing soccer, 
<br>this sport is almost gaining popularity, on my opinion, in our country because when you 
<br>stereotype someone who likes sports the first sport that will come to your mind is basketball, 
<br>but I am surprised to know that he is playing soccer because when in class he seems like 
<br>the one who is not into communicating with others, maybe we are not that close to notice. 
<br>And lastly he likes to hangout with his friends, well who doesn't? I think all of us are 
<br>enjoying the company of our barkadas, in fact that we won't join them if we are not enjoying 
<br>their company.</div>
